# gutenberg-to-bip39
A really really bad way to create a Bitcoin bip39 seed phrase.

Haven't bothered to make this really work because I found a simplier way...

# Working code in simpler.py

Using simpler.py you can turn a piece of sample text into a bip39 compliant seed phase.

It is still a terrible idea but kind of fun.

Whatever you do never put any actual money into a wallet created from one of these seeds!  They are NOT NOT NOT secure (see I said it 3 times, it must be true).
